# PROJECT TITLE
PREVENTION AND DETECTION OF FAKE CHEQUE SCAMS USING BLOCK CHAIN

# ABOUT THE PROJECT

Fake cheque scam is one of the most common attacks used to commit fraud against consumers. Currently, there is no existing solution to authenticate cheques and detect fake ones instantly. Instead, banks must wait for a period of more time and date to detect  the scam. More precisely, our approach helps the banks to share information about provided cheques and used ones, without exposing the banks’ customers’ personal data. Fake cheques come in many forms. They might look like business or personal 
cheques, cashier’s cheques, money orders, or a cheque delivered electronically. These scams work because fake cheques generally look just like real cheques, even to bank 
employees. They are often printed with the names and addresses of legitimate financial institutions. Banks are maintaining security services for money transaction to customer security purpose directly cheque with customer and requires their permission.
